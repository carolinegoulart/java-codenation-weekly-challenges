    Weekly Challenges
</h1>

## :rocket: About this repository

Resolution of weekly Java challenges from the bootcamp AceleraDev Java hosted by Codenation

## :hammer: Tools
* Java 8, JUnit 4, Spring, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, Maven<br>
* MVC Design pattern (for the more advanced challenges), IDE IntellieJ Idea

## :pencil: Challenges

* [Challenge 1: Net salary calculator (methods, lists, conditional, iterative statements)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-01-salary-calculator)
<br>Implement a net salary calculator, which receives a gross salary, apply taxes and returns the net salary. I applied concepts such as lists, arrays, methods, conditional and iterative statements.

* [Challenge 2: Calculating mean, mode and median (methods, lists, conditional, iterative statements)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-01-salary-calculator)
Implement mean, mode and median methods using lists, conditional, and iterative statements.

* [Challenge 3: Parking manager system (exceptions, builder, methods, inheritance)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-03-parking-manager-system)
<br>Create a parking manager system using the builder pattern, applying inheritance and handling exceptions. 

* [Challenge 4: Football teams manager system (exceptions, streams, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-04-football-teams-manager-system)
<br>Implement several methods as listed in the [TeamsApplicationManager](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/blob/master/challenge-04-football-teams-manager-system/DesafioMeuTimeApplication.java) file, understanding concepts like exceptions, collections, streams API, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.

* [Challenge 5: Classes manager (interfaces, annotations, Java reflection)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-05-classes-manager)
<br>Use Java Reflection and annotations to implement the methods in [this](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/blob/master/challenge-05-classes-manager/challenge/CalculadorDeClasses.java) file, searching for classes that have fields of type BigDecimal annotated with either @Sum or @subtract, and performing these opperations.

* [Challenge 6: Creating entities with JPA (Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, entities, Spring Boot)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-06-creating-entities-with-JPA-and-H2-Database)
<br>Create the classes (entities) according to a received entity framework with the relationships between entities, using Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, and annotations (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, etc) to stablish the relationships. The .java files are in the [entities](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-06-creating-entities-with-JPA-and-H2-Database/java/entity) folder.

* [Challenge 7: Creating entities with Spring and H2 Database (Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, SQL, Spring Boot)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-07-creating-entities-with-jpa-and-h2-database)
<br>Here I used Spring Data JPA and SQL queries to generate the CRUD operations for the previous challenge, and also the H2 in-memory database to test the entities that I created. I implemented all the classes for both the [repository](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-07-creating-entities-with-jpa-and-h2-database/java/repository) and [implementation](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-07-creating-entities-with-jpa-and-h2-database/java/service/implementation) folders. 

* [Challenge 8: API Order Service (streams, collections, functional programming, Optional class)](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/tree/master/challenge-08-API-order-service)
<br>Implement the methods in the [OrderServiceImplementaion](https://github.com/carolinegoulart/java-codenation-weekly-challenges/blob/master/challenge-08-API-order-service/main/service/OrderServiceImpl.java) file, receiving the ordered products as an array, searching for each product in the product repository and returning the results, such as the total order value, find products by ID, and group by sale.
